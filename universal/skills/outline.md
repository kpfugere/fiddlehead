# Outline Skill

Create and refine document outlines.

## Purpose

Develop a clear, logical structure for the document that supports the goal in `00_doc_goal.md`.

## Process

1. Review `00_doc_goal.md` to understand the document's purpose
2. Identify main sections that support the goal
3. Organize sections in a logical flow
4. Add subsections to each main section
5. Ensure outline supports the key message/call-to-action

## Output

Update `docs/<DOC>/01_outline.md` with:
- High-level structure
- Section flow
- Key points per section

## Guidelines

- Keep outline focused on the document goal
- Ensure logical progression from start to finish
- Include call-to-action if required by document type
- Keep sections balanced (avoid one section dominating)
