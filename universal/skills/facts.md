# Facts Skill

Gather and verify facts, statistics, quotes, and attributions.

## Purpose

Ensure all factual claims are supported by sources or marked as TODOs.

## Process

1. Identify all facts, statistics, and quotes needed for the document
2. For each fact:
   - Find a reliable source
   - Record the source
   - If no source found, mark as TODO
3. Record quotes with proper attribution
4. Document in `02_key_facts.md`

## Output

Update `docs/<DOC>/02_key_facts.md` with:
- Statistics with sources
- Quotes with attributions
- Facts with sources
- TODOs for missing information

## Hard Rules

- **Never invent facts, stats, quotes, or attributions**
- If a fact is missing and required, mark as TODO
- If a fact is missing but not critical, proceed with qualitative phrasing
- All numbers must have sources or be marked TODO

## Sources Policy

Refer to `universal/06_sources_policy.md` for citation style and requirements.
